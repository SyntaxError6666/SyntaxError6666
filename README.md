###My Telegram:
@SyntaxError6  
**Please note: I do not accept ordinary Telegram private messages.**  
To send me a private message, **please use a Secret Chat**.  
Before sending me a private message, **strictly adhere to and carry out the following steps to prevent any potential man-in-the-middle attacks**:  
1. Subscribe to my channel: [https://t.me/CompareFingerprints](https://t.me/CompareFingerprints)  
2. Open a Secret Chat with me.  
3. Wait for me to publish key fingerprint information (i.e., a fingerprint screenshot).  
4. Open the channel link in a private/incognito browser window while logged out to view the fingerprint information I have published (using a proxy server or VPN is recommended).  
5. Compare the fingerprint information I published with what you see in the browser and the fingerprint displayed in the Secret Chat.  
6. Under the corresponding image in the channel, leave a comment stating the fingerprint information you observed (including whether it matches, and the specific fingerprint value).  
**Why these steps are necessary**:  
1. First, assume that both the endpoint device and its TLS connection to Telegram’s servers are secure (otherwise, your account has already been compromised). In this case, the only risk lies with Telegram’s servers.  
2. Under these circumstances, the only feasible method of attack is the differential display of the fingerprint information I share.  
3. This can be detected by publishing the fingerprint information in a public channel and viewing it while logged out (preferably using a proxy server, VPN, or similar means) to identify any discrepancies.
